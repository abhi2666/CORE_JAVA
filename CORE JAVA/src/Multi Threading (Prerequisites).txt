Prerequsites of Multi Threading  - 

1. Multi Processing 
2. Multi tasking -  when your process is divided into further tasks so as to reduce the load in your system called multi tasking. This is done by your OS.
These sub tasks are also executed concurrently by switching between the tasks. The tasks are written in different threads.

Types if mutli processing and Multi tasking - 
	1. Sequential  
	2. Parallel 
	3. Concurrent 

Sequential - it is the worst processing method. When you have only one core (that is only one Program counter).

Parallel - only possible when you have multiple cores in your system. Multiple instructions are processed simultaneously.

Concurrent - very close to parallel processing. By making threads, we can achieve this. We execute small fraction of each process and switch between them 
making execution speed fucking high. Context Switch is done by OS. 


(If your tasks that are to be executed are sequential then you cannot apply multi threading into it because it is fucking not possible)

Cohesion - when modules are independent of each other.
